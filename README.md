This project aims at building a face recognition attendance system. It covers area such as face detection, image capturing and image recognition, along with a tkinter GUI based window which cater to various use cases of the system such as employee management, viewing and modifying attendance reports, etc. This project intends to serve as a substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in offices, schools, and organizations where seecurity is essential.

## Scope of the project 🚀
Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials.
This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. This project also convers web development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.

**The system works only on one type of user,** i,e. **Admin**

**Following are the functionalities of the admin: <br>**
1. Login<br>
2. Manage Employees<br>
3. Train photos<br>
4. Take attendance<br>
5. View attendance report <br>
